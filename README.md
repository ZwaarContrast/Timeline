Timeline
========

Experiment for creating a timeline script based on DraggableDualViewSlider by Codrops.

This timeline has two different views, one is zoomed out so more slides are shown, the other will adjust to the size of the parent element.

Supports swipe and pinch gestures when jQuery touchswipe library is detected.
